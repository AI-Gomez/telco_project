## Telco Churn

Angel Gomez 09/23/2020

# Goal
The goal of the project is to find the drivers for churn at Telco and create a model to predict churn.

## Project Planning

# First Thoughts
Overall churn rate is at 26% however there are many factors that contribute to churn.

# Hypothesis
Is Tech Support a factor in Churn?
After utilizing the exploration data, it seems there may be a relationship with tech support and churn. 

Do fiber optic customers have a higher rate of churn?
A relationship with fiber customers and churn may exist after plotting the exploration data.

# acquire.py
Creating an acquire.py allows us to acquire data from the telco_churn sql database hosted on the codeup server. 

# prepare.py
The prepare.py hosts our helper functions and other prep code to be implemented in our jupyter notebooks.

# Exploration
By plotting data, we can see any relationships that exist with customer churn.

# Model and Evaluation
Creating a baseline in this stage notifies us if a model is deemed successful by achieving a higher accuracy score. After a baseline has been established, we can now utilize sklearn's train, validate, and test to try out models and see which one performs the best.

# Summary
A summary of our findings and a prediction model in the form of a csv file is included in the summary.
